The application prompts the user to select a color and shape, provide text for the logo, and save the generated SVG to a .svg file.\r Because this application won’t be deployed, you’ll need to provide a link to a walkthrough video that demonstrates its functionality and passes all of the tests. You’ll need to submit a link to the video and add it to the README of your project.\r Refer to the Video Submission Guide on the Full-Stack Blog for additional guidance on creating a video.",
